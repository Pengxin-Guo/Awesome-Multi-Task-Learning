  Notes: decompose the **instance-aware semantic segmentation** task into three different and related sub-tasks; expect that each sub-task is **simpler** than the original instance segmentation task, and is **more easily** addressed by convolutional networks; their network **cascades** have three stages, each of which addresses one sub-task.

  Notes: starts with a thin multi-layer network and *dynamically* **widens** it in a greedy manner during training; creates a **tree-like deep architecture**, on which **similar tasks reside in the same branch** until at the top layers.

## Optimization for Multi-Task Learning

#### Optimization Techniques

#### Loss Balancing

- [**SMTL**, **OSMTL**] Murugesan, K., Liu, H., Carbonell, J., & Yang, Y. [Adaptive smoothed online multi-task learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/a869ccbcbd9568808b8497e28275c7c8-Abstract.html). **NeurIPS**, 2016.

  Notes: *efficiently* learns multiple related tasks by estimating the **task relationship matrix** from the data; maybe can be formulated as an end-to-end training procedure.

#### Gradient Balancing

- Yu, T., Kumar, S., Gupta, A., Levine, S., Hausman, K., & Finn, C. [Gradient surgery for multi-task learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/3fe78a8acf5fda99de95303940a2420c-Abstract.html "PCGrad"). NeurIPS, 2020.

- [**GradNorm**] Chen, Z., Badrinarayanan, V., Lee, C. Y., & Rabinovich, A. [Gradnorm: Gradient normalization for adaptive loss balancing in deep multitask networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/chen18a.html?ref=https://githubhelp.com "GradNorm"). **ICML**, 2018.

  Notes: automatically balances training in deep multitask models by **dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes**; establish a **common scale** for **gradient magnitudes**, and **balance training rates** of different tasks.
  
  Q: **Does it necessary to make the gradient magnitudes of different tasks to a common scale?** or **Why?**

  Notes: introduce an **asymmetric autoencoder** term that allows reliable predictors for the easy
  tasks to have high contribution to the **feature learning** while suppressing the influences of unreliable predictors for more difficult tasks; the reconstruction is done in the **feature space** and in a **non-linear** manner.

- [**MRN**] Long, M., Cao, Z., Wang, J., & Yu, P. S. [Learning multiple tasks with multilinear relationship networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/03e0704b5690a2dee1861dc3ad3316c9-Abstract.html "MRN"). **NeurIPS**, 2017.

  Notes: mainly based on **tensor normal distributions**; jointly learning **transferable features** and **multilinear relationships**, alleviate the dilemma of **negative-transfer** in feature layers and **under-transfer** in classifier layer.

  Notes: generalise matrix factorisation-based multi-task ideas to **tensor factorisation**; **Tucker Decomposition**; **Tensor Train (TT) Decomposition**.

- [**TNRDMTL**] Yang, Y., & Hospedales, T. M. [Trace Norm Regularised Deep Multi-Task Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rknkNR7Ke "TNRDMTL"). **ICLR workshop**, 2017.

  Notes: the parameters from all models are regularised by the **tensor trace norm**.

- [**CILICIA**] Sarafianos, N., Giannakopoulos, T., Nikou, C., & Kakadiaris, I. A. [Curriculum learning for multi-task classification of visual attributes](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/w38/html/Sarafianos_Curriculum_Learning_for_ICCV_2017_paper.html "CILICIA"). **ICCV workshop**, 2017.

  Notes: individual tasks are grouped based on their correlation so that **two groups of strongly and weakly correlated tasks** are formed; the two groups of tasks are learned in a **curriculum learning** setup by transferring the acquired knowledge **from the strongly to the weakly correlated**; the learning process within each group is performed in a **multi-task** classification setup.

- [**HC-MTL**] Liu, A. A., Su, Y. T., Nie, W. Z., & Kankanhalli, M. [Hierarchical clustering multi-task learning for joint human action grouping and recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7423818 "HC-MTL"). **TPAMI**, 2017.

  Notes: formulate the objective function with two latent variables, **model parameters** and **grouping information**, for joint optimization; decompose it into two sub-tasks, **multi-task learning** and **task relatedness discovery**, and **iteratively** solve the two sub-tasks.

- [**HD-MTL**] Fan, J., Zhao, T., Kuang, Z., Zheng, Y., Zhang, J., Yu, J., & Peng, J. [HD-MTL: Hierarchical deep multi-task learning for large-scale visual recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7849143 "HD-MTL"). **TIP**, 2017.

  Notes: **multiple sets of deep features** are extracted from the **different layers**; a **visual tree** is learned by assigning the visually-similar atomic object classes with similar learning complexities into the same group, it can provide a good environment for **identifying the inter-related learning tasks** automatically.

  Notes: avoid **negative transfer** problem; allow for **asymmetric information transfer** between the tasks.

  Assumption: each underlying **model parameter** is *succinctly* represented by the **linear combination** of other parameters.

  Notes: exploit task relatedness in the form of shared representations in both the **original input space** and the **interaction space among features**.

  Notes: a subset of tasks (**representative tasks**) in multi-task learning can be used to represent other tasks due to the similarity among multiple tasks; allow **one task to be clustered into multiple clusters**, and with different weights.
