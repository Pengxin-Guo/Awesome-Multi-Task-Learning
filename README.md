- [**NDDR-CNN**, **NDDR-CNN-Shortcut**] Gao, Y., Ma, J., Zhao, M., Liu, W., & Yuille, A. L. [Nddr-cnn: Layerwise feature fusing in multi-task cnns by neural discriminative dimensionality reduction](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Gao_NDDR-CNN_Layerwise_Feature_Fusing_in_Multi-Task_CNNs_by_Neural_Discriminative_CVPR_2019_paper.html "NDDR-CNN, NDDR-CNN-Shortcut"). **CVPR**, 2019.

  Motivation: **Why would we assume that the low- and mid-level features for different tasks in MTL should be identical, especially when the tasks are loosely related? If not, is it optimal to share the features until the last convolutional layer?**

  Notes: they hypothesize that **these features, obtained from multiple feature descriptors (i.e., different CNN levels from multiple tasks), contain additional discriminative information of input data, which should be exploited in MTL towards better performance**; they **concatenate** all the task-specific features with the same spatial resolution from different tasks according to the feature channel dimension, conduct **discriminative dimensionality reduction** on the concatenated features.

  Notes: consists of a single shared network containing a global feature pool, together with a **soft-attention module for each task**; Dynamic Weight Average (**DWA**), which adapts the task weighting over time by considering the rate of change of the loss for each task.

  Q: **Can we replace the $K$ task-specific attention networks with one task-specific attention network to further reduce the parameters?** This task-specific attention network can receive the task embeddings and the shared features as input.

[Multiple relational attention network for multi-task learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3292500.3330861?casa_token=OWmM19esGkgAAAAA:VcB0sDcRzF_7Sqn6C-F0zAIfgmLUvA-UISFEG3jrdpgcqLT1tTIaJQwKH83jzTGo7tWQcPpfxGgo "MRAN"). **KDD**, 2019.

  Notes: consists of **three attention-based relationship learning modules**: **task-task relationship**, **feature-feature interaction**, and **task-feature dependence**.

- [**PS-MCNN**] Cao, J., Li, Y., & Zhang, Z. [Partially shared multi-task convolutional neural network with local constraint for face attribute learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Cao_Partially_Shared_Multi-Task_CVPR_2018_paper.html "PS-MCNN"). **CVPR**, 2018.

  Notes: the key idea of **PS-MCNN** lies in **sharing a common network for all the groups to learn shared features**, and **constructing group specific network for each group** from the beginning of the architecture to its end to **learn task specific features**; four Task Specific Networks (**TSNets**) and one Shared Network (**SNet**) are connected by Partially Shared (**PS**) structures to learn better **shared** and **task specific** representations.

- [**MMoE**] Ma, J., Zhao, Z., Yi, X., Chen, J., Hong, L., & Chi, E. H. [Modeling task relationships in multi-task learning with multi-gate mixture-of-experts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3219819.3220007 "MMoE"). **KDD**, 2018.

  Notes: adapt the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure to multi-task learning by sharing the expert submodels across all tasks, while also having a **gating network** trained to optimize each task; the gating networks take the input features and **output softmax gates assembling the experts with different weights**, allowing different tasks to utilize experts differently.

  Q1: **How to determine the number of experts? Is it same to the task number?**

  Q2: **What is the architecture of each expert?** Is each expert same to the shared bottom? If this, the model parameters of MMoE will become so large.

  Q3: **Why the shared-bottom method is still inferior to MMoE on two identical tasks?** (Figure 4(c)) **Does it means even for two totally relevant tasks, we still cannot share all the parameters in the bottom layers?**

  Notes: decompose the **instance-aware semantic segmentation** task into three different and related sub-tasks; expect that each sub-task is **simpler** than the original instance segmentation task, and is **more easily** addressed by convolutional networks; their network **cascades** have three stages, each of which addresses one sub-task.

  Notes: carry out the task of **saliency detection** in conjunction with the task of **object class segmentation**, which **share a convolution part** with 15 layers; use two networks performing the two tasks by sharing features, which forms a **tree structured network architecture**.

  Notes: learn the sharing pattern through a task-specific policy that **selectively chooses which layers to execute for a given task** in the multi-task network.

  Q1: It has to perform $T$ times forward pass since each task has different paths, which is time-consuming.

## Optimization for Multi-Task Learning

#### Optimization Techniques

#### Loss Balancing

- [**MultiNet++**, **GLS**] Chennupati, S., Sistu, G., Yogamani, S., & A Rawashdeh, S. [Multinet++: Multi-stream feature aggregation and geometric loss strategy for multi-task learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/html/WAD/Chennupati_MultiNet_Multi-Stream_Feature_Aggregation_and_Geometric_Loss_Strategy_for_Multi-Task_CVPRW_2019_paper.html "MultiNet++, GLS"). **CVPR workshop**, 2019.

  Notes: they propose a **multi-stream multi-task network** to take advantage of using feature representations from **preceding frames in a video sequence** for joint learning of segmentation, depth, and motion; they express the total loss of a multi-task learning problem as **geometric mean** of individual task losses, they refer to this as Geometric Loss Strategy (**GLS**).
  
- [**Uncertainty**] Kendall, A., Gal, Y., & Cipolla, R. [Multi-task learning using uncertainty to weigh losses for scene geometry and semantics](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Kendall_Multi-Task_Learning_Using_CVPR_2018_paper.html "Uncertainty"). **CVPR**, 2018.

  Notes: weighs multiple loss functions by considering the **homoscedastic uncertainty** of each task.
  
  Q1:  Their results show that there is usually not a single optimal weighting for all tasks. Therefore, **what is the optimal weighting?**  Is multi-task learning is an ill-posed optimisation problem without a single higher-level goal?
  
  Q2: Why do the semantics and depth tasks outperform the semantics and instance tasks results? Clearly the three tasks explored in this paper are complimentary and useful for learning a rich representation about the scene. **But can we quantify relationships between tasks?**
  
  Q3: **Where the optimal location is for splitting the shared encoder network into separate decoders for each task?** And, what network depth is best for the shared multi-task representation?
  
- [**Dynamic**] Guo, M., Haque, A., Huang, D. A., Yeung, S., & Fei-Fei, L. [Dynamic task prioritization for multitask learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Michelle_Guo_Focus_on_the_ECCV_2018_paper.html "Dynamic"). **ECCV**, 2018.

  Notes: automatically **prioritize more difficult tasks** by adaptively **adjusting the mixing weight of each taskâ€™s loss objective**.

- [**SPMTL**] Li, C., Yan, J., Wei, F., Dong, W., Liu, Q., & Zha, H. [Self-paced multi-task learning](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/viewFile/14535/14390 "SPMTL"). **AAAI**, 2017.

  Notes: learn the multi-task model in a **self-paced** regime, **from easy instances and tasks to hard instances and tasks**.

- [**SMTL**, **OSMTL**] Murugesan, K., Liu, H., Carbonell, J., & Yang, Y. [Adaptive smoothed online multi-task learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/a869ccbcbd9568808b8497e28275c7c8-Abstract.html). **NeurIPS**, 2016.

  Notes: *efficiently* learns multiple related tasks by estimating the **task relationship matrix** from the data; maybe can be formulated as an end-to-end training procedure.

#### Gradient Balancing

- [**PCGrad**] Yu, T., Kumar, S., Gupta, A., Levine, S., Hausman, K., & Finn, C. [Gradient surgery for multi-task learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/3fe78a8acf5fda99de95303940a2420c-Abstract.html "PCGrad"). **NeurIPS**, 2020.

  Notes: projects a taskâ€™s gradient onto the normal plane of the gradient of any other task that has a **conflicting** gradient, $ \mathbf{g}_{i}=\mathbf{g}_{i}-\frac{\mathbf{g}_{i} \cdot \mathbf{g}_{j}}{\left\|\mathbf{g}_{j}\right\|^{2}} \mathbf{g}_{j} $.

  Q1: **Does the Theorem 2 in their paper means that PCGrad only works under such three conditions, what if the three conditions are not satisfied?**

  Q2: **Is the *tragic triad* of multi-task learning a major factor in making optimization for multi-task learning challenging?** They seem do not answer this question in their experiments.

- [**GradNorm**] Chen, Z., Badrinarayanan, V., Lee, C. Y., & Rabinovich, A. [Gradnorm: Gradient normalization for adaptive loss balancing in deep multitask networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/chen18a.html?ref=https://githubhelp.com "GradNorm"). **ICML**, 2018.

  Notes: automatically balances training in deep multitask models by **dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes**; establish a **common scale** for **gradient magnitudes**, and **balance training rates** of different tasks.
  
  Q: **Does it necessary to make the gradient magnitudes of different tasks to a common scale?** or **Why?**
  
- [**Modulation**] Zhao, X., Li, H., Shen, X., Liang, X., & Wu, Y. [A modulation module for multi-task learning with applications in image retrieval](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Xiangyun_Zhao_A_Modulation_Module_ECCV_2018_paper.html "Modulation"). **ECCV**, 2018.

  Notes: propose a general **modulation module**, which can be inserted into any convolutional neural network architecture, to encourage the **coupling and feature sharing of relevant tasks** while **disentangling the learning of irrelevant tasks** with minor parameters addition; equipped with this module, **gradient directions from different tasks can be enforced to be consistent for those shared parameters**.

  Q1: Is it harmful if we force the gradient direction of **irrelevant tasks** to be consistent with the shared parameters? Since the objective of this work is to make the gradient directions of different tasks to be consistent, does it will be worse if the gradient direction of **irrelevant tasks** to be consistent?

  Q2: Why "Since the task-specific masks/projection matrices are **learnable**, we observe that the
  training process will *naturally* mitigate the destructive interference by reducing the average across-task gradient angles" ? **What term in the loss function guide this phenomenon?**

  Q3: They simply apply a **channel-wise scaling vector** in their method, what will happen if we use **both channel attention and spatial attention**?

  Notes: introduce a **task-routing** mechanism allowing tasks to have separate in-model data flows; apply a **channel-wise task-specific binary mask** over the convolutional activations, **the masks are generated randomly and kept constant**.

  Q: What if the randomly generated masks is not suitable? **Is it better to make the masks learnable parameters?**
